## HOW THE APP WORKS

**_For more detailed info regarding features refer to_** `docs/activity_diagram.drawio`<br/>
There are 2 kinds of user who participate in this application: a business owner and experts.<br /><br />
**_As a business owner_**:
You create a business page, fill in the information about your business, the problem you currently facing, and upload a business problem proposal file which further describe in detail about your business problem and what you want to do to solve/improve your business. Your business page can be viewed by experts who might be interested in your problem and willing to offer their mentoring program. On the other hand you can also find mentor program created by experts and offer a request to be mentored by that specific expert.
<br /><br />
**_As an expert_**:
You can create a general mentoring program which solve a problem that you specialized in. You'll need to fill in the information about your program, how long does it last, and how much you charge for it. Your mentoring program can be viewed by business owners who might be interested and offer a request to be mentored by you. On the other hand you can find business problem created by business owner and send a request to mentor that specific business.
<br /><br />
Once a request is initiated by either the business owner or expert, both party can discuss the problem and whether or not they agree to establish a mentor room. Before establishing a mentor room, expert must create a specific proposal for that specific business which consist of the information of what effort will be taken during the mentoring program. To establish a mentor room the business owner need to pay the fee to our app, and only then the mentor room can be established and the mentoring program can be started.
